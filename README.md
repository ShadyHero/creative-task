my creative task
This code is intended to be used with the carnegie mellon university online python IDE. it will most likely not work elsewhere though i have not tested it.
in this repository you will see "creative task" this is a mostly fully functional recreation of chess.
"creative task 1.5" is the sandbox code i have used to create the pieces using CMU's built-in graphics engine.
